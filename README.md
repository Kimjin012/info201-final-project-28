# Group 28 - Trinh, Marc, Noah, Jin

This project is focuses on the data set we have gahter that has the record of the level of the Carbon Dioxide throughout time from 1751.
From two different sources, the ESRL and NASA, we were able to gather the Average CO2 level globally and from where it is coming from,
such as which fuel and what manufactoring.
The web has Introduction to explain the project to give simple objective of the learning, the body paragraph that has all the data sets and
it's explaination. And the Conclusion for further understanding of how and what is changing of CO2 level is doing to the Earth and it's
surface.
Two shiny has been added for the user to interact with the data set, it let user to change the time zone and the source itself from two 
different plot. It helps the user/audience to check different sources by getting more familiar with the time and changes.
